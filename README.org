AtlasForge is an open-source system that generates an interactive web atlas for any gene family through automated data retrieval and analysis.

* Requirements
- Python 3.12 or newer
- [[https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/][MAFFT]] for computing multiple-sequence alignment

MAFFT is optional when both ~atlasforge fetch~ and ~atlasforge build~ use
~--skip-clustering~.

For development, the frontend requires Node.js. However, the recommended
development setup uses Docker and the Dev Container CLI to automatically
include all the dependencies.

* TODO Quick start
Install the complete data pipeline:

#+begin_src bash
pip install 'atlasforge[pipeline]'
#+end_src

Then fetch, build, and serve a family:

#+begin_src bash
atlasforge fetch 752 --data-dir ./my-atlas
atlasforge build --data-dir ./my-atlas
atlasforge serve --data-dir ./my-atlas
#+end_src

*Note:* ~atlasforge serve~ runs the dynamic server and generates API responses on
demand. For public or high-traffic deployments, use ~atlasforge export~ with a
static web server for better performance.

Here, ~752~ is an HGNC gene group ID. You can instead pass a text file containing
one gene symbol or Ensembl gene ID per line, or a downloaded HGNC group TSV.
Alternatively, you can run ~atlasforge fetch~ without any options for a fully
interactive setup.

The fetch command comes with an interactive setup to guide you through
processing a new gene family. Once you run all three commands, open
[[http://localhost:8000]] to see the running atlas.

The first fetch creates curation files and then pauses for user inspection.
Review the family names, excluded genes, display symbols, species, and UniProt
mappings in ~my-atlas/curation/~, and then run the command printed in the
terminal. Existing files are never overwritten, so you can rerun a fetch to
update any missing data.

* Documentation
See the [[file:docs/README.org][documentation overview]] for guides to AtlasForge's files and performance.
See [[file:docs/example-atlases.org][Example atlases]] for building the atlas using histone and HOX examples.

* Available Views

* Fetch and build options
Use ~atlasforge fetch --help~ and ~atlasforge build --help~ for the complete command
reference. The options most often used when creating a dataset are:

| Option                         | Purpose                                                                 |

Downloaded data lives in ~source/~, personal decisions in ~curation/~, reusable
downloads in ~cache/~, and the finished dataset in ~app/~. See [[file:docs/source-files.org][Source files]] if you
want to edit, replace, or generate those inputs yourself.

* Naming and configuration
Each setting can be supplied as an ~ATLASFORGE_*~ environment variable, in a ~.env~ file,
or as a flag on ~atlasforge serve~ and ~atlasforge export~. A flag takes priority over the
environment, which takes priority over ~.env~.

| Variable                   | Flag              | Purpose                                                  |
|----------------------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~ATLASFORGE_DATA_DIR~        | ~--data-dir~        | Dataset containing ~curation/~, ~source/~, ~cache/~, and ~app/~  |
| ~ATLASFORGE_WEB_DIR~         | ~--web-dir~         | Built frontend files to serve                            |
| ~ATLASFORGE_APP_NAME~        | ~--app-name~        | Full name used by the page and web app manifest          |
| ~ATLASFORGE_APP_SHORT_NAME~  | ~--app-short-name~  | Short name used in the app bar                           |
| ~ATLASFORGE_APP_DESCRIPTION~ | ~--app-description~ | Description shown on the Genes view and in page metadata |
| ~ATLASFORGE_FAMILY_LABEL~    | ~--family-label~    | Singular name used for a family member                   |
| ~ATLASFORGE_DOWNLOAD_PREFIX~ | ~--download-prefix~ | Prefix for downloaded figures, tables, and trees         |
| ~ATLASFORGE_CORS_ORIGINS~    | ~--cors-origins~    | Comma-separated origins allowed to call the API          |
| ~ATLASFORGE_HOST~            | ~--host~            | Address used by ~atlasforge serve~                         |
| ~ATLASFORGE_PORT~            | ~--port~            | Port used by ~atlasforge serve~                            |

Naming changes take effect when the site restarts or is exported again. The dataset does
not need to be rebuilt.

* Deployment
While ~atlasforge serve~ is convenient for local use, a public atlas should run through Docker
or a static web server for reliable restarts, HTTPS, and normal production traffic.

** Docker
Build the dataset first, then point the ~./data~ volume in ~docker-compose.yml~ at
its directory and set the ~ATLASFORGE_*~ names for your atlas:

#+begin_src bash
docker compose up --build
#+end_src

Open [[http://localhost:8080]]. The container exports the site when it starts and
serves it through nginx. Put a reverse proxy in front of it when you need HTTPS;
see the [[https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/web-server/reverse-proxy/][nginx guide]] or [[https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy][Caddy guide]] for more details on reverse proxying.

** Static hosting
Export the whole atlas when you already have a web server or want a portable snapshot:

#+begin_src bash
atlasforge export ./site --data-dir ./my-atlas
rsync -a ./site/ user@host:/var/www/atlas/
#+end_src

The output works with nginx, Apache, Caddy, S3, GitHub Pages, and other static
hosts as long as it supports byte-range requests. It must also serve ~404.html~
for unknown page routes while leaving missing files under ~/api/~ as real 404
responses. You can look at [[file:deploy/nginx.conf][deploy/nginx.conf]] for a complete example.
Re-export after changing the dataset or the site name.

To sync the exported atlas to an S3 bucket, use the AWS CLI:

#+begin_src bash
aws s3 sync ./site/ s3://example-atlas-bucket/
#+end_src

A typical AWS deployment uses the S3 bucket as the origin and puts CloudFront in
front of it for HTTPS, a custom domain, and CDN caching. After an update, cached
files with stable names may need a CloudFront invalidation. See
[[file:scripts/deploy.sh][scripts/deploy.sh]] for a complete example that assigns cache headers, preserves
the large data trees unless pruning is requested, and invalidates changed binary files.

* TODO Development
The dev container is the easiest way to setup the project with Python, Node.js,
MAFFT, and the project dependencies bundled. Install Docker and the Dev
Container CLI, and then run:

#+begin_src bash
./enter-dev.sh
./dev-zellij.sh
#+end_src

The frontend runs at [[http://localhost:3000]] and sends API requests to FastAPI at
[[http://localhost:8000]]. See [[file:.devcontainer/README.org][Dev container setup]] for direct CLI commands and container
details.

For a manual setup:

#+begin_src bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[pipeline,dev]'
npm --prefix web ci
fastapi dev src/atlasforge/main.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
npm --prefix web run dev
#+end_src

Run the two development servers in separate terminals. Before submitting a change, run
~black --check src scripts~, ~npm --prefix web run format:check~, and
~npm --prefix web run build~.
